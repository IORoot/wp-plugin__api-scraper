# Import

The importer is used to take any mapped objects and import them into wordpress.

This will do a number of things:

1. check the post exists
2. create the post
3. download the image
4. create an image post object
5. attach metadata to the post
6. attach the image to the post object
7. associate the correct taxonomy term to the post
