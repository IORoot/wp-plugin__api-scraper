# Files

## acf_export_deashboard

These are JSON exports of the ACF interface for the scraper. Even though the interface is loaded via the PHP version located in `/src/acf/dashboard.php` these files allow you to import and update the dashboard to your choosing.

## demo_Dashboard

These are demo data examples of all pieces of the interface. Using the import/export page you can select the `options.json` file and load in the demo examples to help understand how to use the scraper.
